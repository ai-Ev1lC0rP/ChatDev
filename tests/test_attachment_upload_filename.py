"""Regression tests for issue #638.

``AttachmentService.save_upload_file`` joined the client-supplied multipart
filename onto a freshly created temp directory without sanitization. A filename
containing ``../`` segments escaped that directory, so the upload wrote
attacker-controlled bytes to an arbitrary host path and the cleanup ``unlink``
then deleted that same traversed path -- arbitrary file write and delete behind
an unauthenticated endpoint.

These tests pin the basename normalisation and prove a traversal filename can no
longer reach a victim file outside the temp/WareHouse area.
